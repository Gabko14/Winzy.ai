Backend detection logic is in Challenge Service (Winzy.ai-zt8).\n\n## How It Works\n1. User completes a habit (POST /habits/{id}/complete)\n2. Challenge Service detects milestone reached via NATS (handled in Winzy.ai-zt8)\n3. Notification Service sends push notification (Winzy.ai-2oa)\n4. Frontend receives notification and triggers celebration UI\n\n## Frontend — Celebration Moment\n- [ ] Full-screen celebration overlay when challenge is completed\n- [ ] Show what was achieved ('You reached 80% consistency!')\n- [ ] Show the reward ('Time for your hike together!')\n- [ ] Confetti or flame animation (Winzy.ai-fn1)\n- [ ] Share/celebrate button\n\n## Reward Claiming\n- [ ] Both users can see the pending reward in challenge detail (GET /challenges/{id})\n- [ ] 'Mark as done' button (PUT /challenges/{id}/claim)\n- [ ] Reward history in challenge details\n\n## Notifications\n- [ ] Recipient: 'You completed the challenge! Time for [reward]'\n- [ ] Creator: '[Friend] completed your challenge! Plan your [reward]'\n\n## Notes\n- This should feel like a genuine celebration, not a transaction\n- The reward is a SHARED experience — emphasize togetherness\n- Tone: Joyful and warm\n\n(Originally GH RewardStack #56)","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"Winzy.ai-6pj","is_template":0,"issue_type":"feature","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"gabkolistiak@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":3,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"open","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Challenge completion flow","updated_at":"2026-02-25T12:50:56Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

This is passive accountability with zero friction on the other side.\n\n## Core Concept\n- Each user gets a public profile: winzy.ai/@username\n- Shows only habits marked as 'public' visibility\n- Displays live flame for each public habit\n- Beautiful, shareable, mobile-optimized page\n- No authentication required to view\n\n## Public Profile Page\n- [ ] Route: /@{username} (frontend)\n- [ ] User's display name + avatar\n- [ ] List of public habits with live flames\n- [ ] Each flame shows consistency percentage\n- [ ] 'I want my own Flame' CTA button → sign up page\n- [ ] Clean, minimal design — this IS marketing\n\n## Embeddable Flame Badge\n- [ ] Route: /api/flame/{username}.svg (backend)\n- [ ] Dynamic SVG showing aggregate flame state\n- [ ] Embed anywhere: Twitter bio, blog, Notion, email signature\n- [ ] Like shields.io badges but beautiful and animated\n- [ ] Links back to public profile page\n\n## Visibility Extension\n- [ ] Add 'public' option to visibility enum (currently: private, friends)\n- [ ] Update Social Service visibility_settings (Winzy.ai-bdd)\n- [ ] Update frontend visibility toggle (Winzy.ai-o84)\n- [ ] Default remains private — user explicitly opts in to public\n\n## Backend\n- [ ] GET /habits/public/{username} — unauthenticated endpoint on Habit Service\n- [ ] Returns only habits with visibility=public + their consistency scores\n- [ ] Username resolution: use existing GET /auth/users/search?q={username} (Auth Service, Winzy.ai-dhq)\n- [ ] Rate limited to prevent scraping\n\n## Why This Matters\n1. Kills the cold-start problem — friend doesn't need an account\n2. Viral distribution — every shared link is a landing page\n3. Passive accountability at maximum — just a URL\n4. Technically simple — one public route, one unauthenticated endpoint\n5. Every flame embed is free advertising\n\n## Notes\n- The public page must be STUNNING — it's the first thing potential users see\n- Keep it fast (static-ish, cache aggressively)\n- QR code generation for easy sharing (print it, stick it on your desk)\n- Username must be unique and URL-safe (set during registration or profile edit)","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"Winzy.ai-szy","is_template":0,"issue_type":"feature","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"gabkolistiak@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"open","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Public Flame Page (winzy.ai/@username)","updated_at":"2026-02-25T15:20:24Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
