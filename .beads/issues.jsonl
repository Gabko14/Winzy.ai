This is passive accountability with zero friction on the other side.\n\n## Core Concept\n- Each user gets a public profile: winzy.ai/@username\n- Shows only habits marked as 'public' visibility\n- Displays live flame for each public habit\n- Beautiful, shareable, mobile-optimized page\n- No authentication required to view\n\n## Public Profile Page\n- [ ] Route: /@{username} (frontend)\n- [ ] User's display name + avatar\n- [ ] List of public habits with live flames\n- [ ] Each flame shows consistency percentage\n- [ ] 'I want my own Flame' CTA button → sign up page\n- [ ] Clean, minimal design — this IS marketing\n\n## Embeddable Flame Badge\n- [ ] Route: /api/flame/{username}.svg (backend)\n- [ ] Dynamic SVG showing aggregate flame state\n- [ ] Embed anywhere: Twitter bio, blog, Notion, email signature\n- [ ] Like shields.io badges but beautiful and animated\n- [ ] Links back to public profile page\n\n## Visibility Extension\n- [ ] Add 'public' option to visibility enum (currently: private, friends)\n- [ ] Update Social Service visibility_settings (Winzy.ai-bdd)\n- [ ] Update frontend visibility toggle (Winzy.ai-o84)\n- [ ] Default remains private — user explicitly opts in to public\n\n## Backend\n- [ ] GET /habits/public/{username} — unauthenticated endpoint on Habit Service\n- [ ] Returns only habits with visibility=public + their consistency scores\n- [ ] Username resolution: use existing GET /auth/users/search?q={username} (Auth Service, Winzy.ai-dhq)\n- [ ] Rate limited to prevent scraping\n\n## Why This Matters\n1. Kills the cold-start problem — friend doesn't need an account\n2. Viral distribution — every shared link is a landing page\n3. Passive accountability at maximum — just a URL\n4. Technically simple — one public route, one unauthenticated endpoint\n5. Every flame embed is free advertising\n\n## Notes\n- The public page must be STUNNING — it's the first thing potential users see\n- Keep it fast (static-ish, cache aggressively)\n- QR code generation for easy sharing (print it, stick it on your desk)\n- Username must be unique and URL-safe (set during registration or profile edit)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"gabkolistiak@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-25T13:22:27Z","created_by":"Gabko14","updated_at":"2026-02-25T15:20:24Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"Winzy.ai-szy","depends_on_id":"Winzy.ai-6m3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-25T14:52:02Z","created_by":"Gabko14","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"Winzy.ai-szy","depends_on_id":"Winzy.ai-e4e","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-25T14:51:27Z","created_by":"Gabko14","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"Winzy.ai-szy","depends_on_id":"Winzy.ai-wxa","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-25T14:52:02Z","created_by":"Gabko14","metadata":"{}"}]}
